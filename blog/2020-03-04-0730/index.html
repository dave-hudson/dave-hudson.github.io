                    <p>If there&rsquo;s a theme in my life it has been an obsession with computers.  I started when I was 9 and still have books
on my shelves from the late 70s and early 80s when that passion was new - thank you, Dad!  Every one of those books, and
their successors, taught me a new way to understand and imagine things I could get computers to do.</p>
<p>A random trip to a University bookshop led me to discover Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht&rsquo;s book,
<a href="../../../elements/research-resources/1992-Project-Oberon.pdf">&ldquo;Project Oberon&rdquo;</a>.  Systems programming had always been
a fascination, but this was a revelation.  I still recommend it as a fantastic insight into how to build a hugely
complex system from nothing.  Reading this book had a surprising side effect.  It made me aware of a thing called the
Internet.  With access to that, I could get more information and code via FTP.</p>
<p>Finding an ISP in 1992 was harder than it sounds.  You couldn&rsquo;t just search for an ISP on the web.  The web didn&rsquo;t really
exist, and you needed an ISP to get to it!  Eventually, I did find a dial-up provider and with that, the world
opened up - at 2400 bps.  Yes, that&rsquo;s 2.4k bps, 0.0024 Mbps.  The home page for this blog is currently about 90 kBytes,
compressed.  At those speeds, it would take just over 6 minutes to load!</p>
<p>While I went looking for all things Oberon, I found something else.  A lot of CS departments had started to share
research papers via anonymous FTP, so I started to download and read them.  Suddenly, I could trawl everything from the
latest works on language design and operating, but I could also find the MIT AI Lab&rsquo;s back catalogue.  The latter began
a love of reading older research classics.  Many of these explore entirely new ways of doing things.  With each one, I
learned to see the world of computing from different perspectives and with a new sense of possibilities.  I&rsquo;ve been
looking for more ever since.</p>
<p>Over the years I lost a few.  Hard drives failed without backups.  Weblinks went dead.  Cloud services showed they
were not as reliable as I might have hoped.  So now I&rsquo;ve collected them all again, put them in a git repo,
and am serving them up <a href="/elements/research-resources/">here</a>.</p>
<p>All the papers that made it to this site are ones I value.  While playing librarian, though, I rediscovered a few
long-lost friends.</p>
