                    <p>One of the more common questions asked when people think about the scale
of Bitcoin mining is just how much electricity is being spent supporting
the worldwide hashing activities.  The question becomes more interesting
once it&rsquo;s realized that hashing performs no useful function other than
to support mining.</p>
<p>While the green footprint is of interest to many, the electricity costs
turn out to play a much more interesting role in predicting future
mining behaviour.  They play a major role in defining the viability of
mining hardware, help determine the upper limit on the worldwide hashing
rate and the potential scale of future mining operations.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-electricity-costs">What are the electricity costs?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing (2014-04-27) a state-of-the-art 28 nm mining ASIC
achieves between 700 and 800 GH/s at a power cost of about 0.65 W/GH/s.
The current worldwide hashing rate is hovering around 57 PH/s and so
that equates to about 37 MW.  While this defines a theoretical minimum
power consumption it&rsquo;s nowhere near the actual number; most mining is
not using state-of-the-art hardware and is probably operating at closer
to 1 to 2 W/GH/s.  If we assume an average of 1.5 W/GH/s then that would
probably give a more realistic power requirement of about 86 MW.</p>
<p>There is a small amount of hashing capacity provided by older, much less
efficient designs but we can largely ignore these systems for our
purposes; very few miners can sustain operating at a substantial
operating loss.  Similarly there are newer designs due to ship within a
month or two that may reduce the power requirements to 0.52 W/GH/s and
potentially less, but these aren&rsquo;t apparently contributing to the
current hashrate in any very significant way.  We&rsquo;re also choosing to
ignore the costs of hardware that control the mining ASICs and the PSU
inefficiencies.</p>
<p>If we take our 86 MW number then that equates to 2.06M kWh of
electricity per day.  Electricity prices vary quite a lot based on
location but the range is probably as low as $0.08 all the way through
to $0.50 (see <a href="http://energyusecalculator.com/global_electricity_prices.htm">energyusecalculator.com/global_electricity_prices</a>),
but a reasonable working average might be $0.20.  Commercial users might
average a lower raw cost for electricity, but they will often have to
pay for cooling systems that in turn take electricity and so have an
amortized cost that is probably not dissimilar.</p>
<p>At this level the electricity bill for the worldwide hashing would
currently be $413k per day (about $151M per year!).</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-affect-peak-hashing-rates">How does this affect peak hashing rates?</h2>
<p>In an earlier article, &ldquo;<a href="/blog/2014-04-03-0000/">The rewards for a Bitcoin miner</a>&quot;,
we looked at how hardware costs and mining rewards could put an upper
limit on the worldwide hashing rate, but this didn&rsquo;t really try to
account for operating costs.  If we start to think about these it starts
to provide some new insights!</p>
<p>First we need to consider the total Bitcoin mining rewards that are
available each day.  With the BTC price at around $450, the current
growth in hashing rate and the current transaction fees the available
mining reward is around $2M per day.</p>
<p>If we take our electricity estimate of $413k per day then that still
leaves us with about $1.58M left over.  If we ignore any need to pay
other overheads then that can in theory just go on paying for new
hashing hardware.  Of course this isn&rsquo;t really possible and our miners
still need to deduct money for equipment space, cooling, salaries,
replace failed hardware, taxes and of course any profits.  We can get an
upper bound this way though, so it&rsquo;s still useful.</p>
<p>At $3.20 per GH/s then $1.58M pays for a little over 490 TH/s per day,
or about 28.6 PH/s of extra capacity after 58 days.  At the beginning of
March 2014 our total hash rate was around 30 PH/s, while 58 days later
we&rsquo;re at 57 PH/s and have thus added a net 27 PH/s.  That&rsquo;s
surprisingly close!</p>
<h2 id="the-runaway-mine-train-slowing-down">The runaway mine train slowing down?</h2>
<p>As new hardware goes online, older, far less efficient devices, drop off
the network so the additional capacity isn&rsquo;t purely additive.  A
percentage of our original capacity will have been lost this way and
other losses will occur because of equipment failures.  All this suggests
that for the moment, at least, hashing capacity is being added at a rate
that is probably not even close to breaking even for many of those
concerned.  Total mining rewards are being fully absorbed by new
hardware, yet those other overheads are very real.</p>
<p>Most of this recently added hashing capacity was prepaid when the BTC
price was much higher and expectations of returns were equally higher.
The past few months will have certainly curtailed much of that
enthusiasm. It seems very likely that in the short term a lot more older
mining hardware will have to shut down and the purchase of newer
hardware will slow down unless the BTC price recovers significantly.
This probably has the largest impact on anyone looking to mine on a
commercial scale because they have to generate profits to return to
investors as well as cover costs.</p>
<p>In another article, &ldquo;<a href="/blog/2014-03-23-0000/">Where next for Bitcoin mining ASICs?</a>&quot;,
some thought was given to how much opportunity there is to see much more
efficient hashing hardware.  It seems inevitable that technology will no
longer offer a path to dramatically higher hashing rates at the same
capital and operating costs.  That can only mean one thing, hashing rate
increases will become much more incremental.  There is some evidence that
this is already happening and where only a few months ago hashing rates
were increasing 10x every 4 months, they&rsquo;re now starting to take
longer.  This no longer seems surprising given what we have just
calculated.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-the-trend">Modeling the trend</h2>
<p>In order to better understand this it seemed a good model was required.
I built a simulation (written in C) that calculates mining behaviour
using a more refined version of the ideas presented above.  As with
all models there are some assumptions, so here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume that ASICs will improve incrementally every day to deliver 2x
more hashing every 2 years.  Technology changes usually come in jumps
so this will probably over-estimate hashing slightly.</li>
<li>Predict that the power consumption per hash will reduce by 50% in
the same 2 years.  In practice this is probably over-optimistic as
Moore&rsquo;s Law only really allows for a total improvement of 2x every
2 years and this is a cumulative 4x improvement but it seems likely
that there&rsquo;s still more room to improve ASIC designs.</li>
<li>Assume steady changes in the  BTC price over the course of the 2
years it runs for.  Again the validity of this approach can be argued
but the impact on results is relatively small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the prediction.  Data prior to May 2014 is actual measured
data from <a href="http://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>, while the 2 years after
are predicted.</p>
<p><img src="./hash-predict.png" alt="Predictions of the Bitcoin hashing rate April 2014.  Shows an S curveappearing"></p>
<p>The vertical axis is logarithmic and clearly shows how the hashing rate
will slow down over the next two years.  What&rsquo;s somewhat interesting is
that whether the BTC price remains the same, doubles or quadruples over
that time the effect is still pronounced.  The hashing rate continues to
grow, but slows dramatically.  What&rsquo;s also important to reiterate is
that these represent the highest hashing rates that can be achieved;
when other overheads and profits are taken then the growth rate will be
lower and flatter.</p>
<h2 id="warehouse-scale-mining">Warehouse scale mining?</h2>
<p>Mainstream server farms in small data centres were the model of
computing for many years, but the need for power and management
efficiency has driven the development of warehouse scale computing
facilities.  These same motivators clearly affect Bitcoin mining too.</p>
<p>For most of the last year the exponential hashing growth rate has meant
that mining has necessarily been focused on the short term, a trend that
is all but totally incompatible with the sorts of investments required
to operate at warehouse scale.  The predicted slowdown should start to
change that quite dramatically.</p>
<p>Warehouse scale designs can operate with the lowest electricity costs
and lowest cooling costs while also enabling more cost effective
maintenance.  Large scale mining also allows dramatic reductions in
equipment costs; the unit price for 10000 ASICs will be dramatically
lower than for 10.</p>
<p>It is somewhat ironic that rather the decentralized hashing we may be on
the verge of moving much of it into large, highly centralized, mining
facilities.</p>
