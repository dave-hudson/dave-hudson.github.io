      <description>When I created this site I was thinking that it would be a fairly traditional blog site, but had always intended to capture my work in progress too. I could have done that in the blog posts, but that risked diluting their value. The blog posts should really represent carefully curated work.
To this end I&amp;rsquo;ve now created the &amp;ldquo;Journal&amp;rdquo; area. This is a space to drop notes as I go.</description>
