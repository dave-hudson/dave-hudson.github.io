                                &#34;Exahash&#34; sounds like it could well have been the hammer of the Norse Gods of old as it defeated all in battle.  In the Bitcoin world of early 2016, however, a mining network that achieves one exahash per second will soon become part of the new folklore.  It will, as others before it, quantitatively destroy all earlier incarnations of itself.  Common wisdom that this ever-increasing hash rate makes the Bitcoin network continually stronger, but what does that strength mean?  What is it stronger than?  What guarantees does it offer? The answer, as so often, is perhaps less clear-cut than we might first imagine!

                                As we approach 2016 there seem to be endless discussions about &#34;blockchain&#34;.  It&#39;s a term that is ever-more frequently cited in even mainstream journalism, while in the fintech space alone there are a slew of would-be suppliers and would-be users claiming that &#34;blockchain&#34; will revolutionize any number of applications.  This now-common usage suggests it must be something precisely defined and well understood, but this seems to be more a matter of mantra than comprehension.  The echo chambers of the Internet reverberate to many opinions, but attempts to find a precise meaning seem to find a dismaying lack of agreement.  To be anything more than marketing hyperbole we really need the answers some questions.  What is it?  What isn&#39;t it?  What might it be?  Can it be something that will allow us to build new and enduring systems?  In short, what is the essence of blockchain?

                                In November 2014 I wrote an article, &#34;Bitcoin traffic bulletin&#34; that sought to look at what happens if the Bitcoin network started to get congested.  Since then there has been considerable debate about the Bitcoin block size and there are now many proposals to increase block capacity.  The original asked questions about what it would mean to reach, say, 50% block capacity but events have moved on and we&#39;re at nearer to 60% at the time of writing.  It&#39;s probably a good time to review things once more!
