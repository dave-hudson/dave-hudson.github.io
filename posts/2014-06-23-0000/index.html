                    <p>Every so often a Bitcoin mining pool is reported to manage more than
half of the Bitcoin hashing capacity, exposing the spectre of a so
called &ldquo;51% attack&rdquo;.  Ignoring the perceived threat though, can we
really trust the statistics?  We&rsquo;ve seen, previously, that Bitcoin
mining statistics aren&rsquo;t quite as obvious as we might hope, so what do
they look like in these cases?</p>
<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-a-50-mining-pool">A day in the life of a 50% mining pool</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what happens when a Bitcoin mining pool has 50% of the
actual global hash rate and see what the estimated statistics look like
for 24 hours.  We&rsquo;ll start by considering what happens when there&rsquo;s no
expansion occuring in the network.  Here&rsquo;s what we find from a Monte
Carlo simulation with 10M trials:</p>
<p><img src="./24hours0percent.png" alt="Mining pool with 50% of the Bitcoin network over 24 hours, assuming no network hash rate expansion"></p>
<p>One curious thing is to note that around the 50% level we see the
cumulative statistics actually become a little &ldquo;blocky&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s
because there turn out to be a limited number of values that can occur.</p>
<p>With 50% of the hashing capacity we do indeed see an average rate where
50% of the blocks are found by our mining pool, but one day in ten
we&rsquo;ll see the network hashing rate for the pool at 43.1% and less, or
56.8% or more.  In practice if we&rsquo;re not seeing more than 50% every
other day then the pool we&rsquo;re looking at probably doesn&rsquo;t really have
at least half of the network hash rate; an odd day above is really not
as interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if it makes much difference if our network hash rate is
expanding at 2% per day:</p>
<p><img src="./24hours2percent.png" alt="Mining pool with 50% of the Bitcoin network over 24 hours, assuming a 2% network hash rate expansion"></p>
<p>The 2% per day hash rate expansion is pretty extreme, corresponding to a
difficulty change of 24.8% on average, but this doesn&rsquo;t actually make
much difference.  Our &ldquo;once in ten days&rdquo; metric now has ranges of 43.5%
or less and 56.4% and greater.</p>
<h2 id="50-for-2016-blocks">50% for 2016 blocks</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen what happens on a daily basis, but what happens when we look
at the 2016 block difficulty change?  Here&rsquo;s the simulation for the
network when no expansion is occuring:</p>
<p><img src="./2016blocks0percentgrowth.png" alt="2016 Bitcoin blocks for a pool having 50% of the network and with no network expansion"></p>
<p>Even over 2016 blocks (14 days on average) we can see quite a lot of
variability in the measured hash rates.  One difficulty change in five
we&rsquo;ll see a discrepancy in the estimated pool hash rate of more than
+/- 1.4%.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>As with many of the Bitcoin statistics we&rsquo;ve seen, things are rarely as
clear-cut as they first appear.  We really need to see more than 55%, and
probably close to 60%, of the hash rate being assigned to a pool within
any 24 hour period before that alone is sufficient to say that the pool
has achieved 50% of the network hash rate.</p>
<p>None of this diminishes the potential risk associated with a single
owner gaining a majority of the network hashing, but as we&rsquo;ve seen
before, we should be wary that daily statistics alone aren&rsquo;t enough to
show that this level has been reached.</p>
