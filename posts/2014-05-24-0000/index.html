                    <p>Everyone knows that mining is a noisy task.  Did you realize just how
noisy Bitcoin mining is though?  These aren&rsquo;t the noises you were
looking for&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="high-noise-level-warning-signhigh-noise-levelsjpg"><img src="./high-noise-levels.jpg" alt="High noise level warning sign"></h2>
<h2 id="a-simple-question">A Simple Question</h2>
<p>An earlier article, &ldquo;<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27:hash-rate-headaches&amp;catid=8:analysis&amp;Itemid=110">Hash Rate Headaches</a>&quot;,
looked at the statistics associated with Bitcoin mining and how it is a
random Poisson Process.  It was pretty clear that the global hashing
rate, and thus the Bitcoin mining difficulty, are subject to quite a lot
of noise, but it wasn&rsquo;t completely obvious how much.</p>
<p>One way to think about this is to ask a simple question: If the hash
rate stayed constant for 52 difficulty changes (approximately 2 years)
then what would happen to the Bitcoin difficulty during that time?</p>
<p>Intuitively it seems that the difficulty shouldn&rsquo;t really change, but
what are the statistics?  This seemed like an interesting thing to try to
unravel so I built another simulator (it&rsquo;s another one written in C,
please <a href="contact">contact me</a> if you&rsquo;d like to know more about it).</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-mining-simulation">A Simple Mining Simulation</h2>
<p>The simulation sets up a nomalized difficulty of 1 and then models each
individual block being found.  Every 2016 blocks it then updates the the
difficulty and the random mining continues.  It&rsquo;s not a perfect
simulation because it ignores network latency or the possibility of
orphaned blocks, but these have a very small impact.  Here&rsquo;s one run:</p>
<p><img src="./simulation.png" alt="Chart showing noise spikes in the Bitcoin difficulty based on a simulation at a constant hash rate" title="Bitcoin difficulty simulated with constant hash rate"></p>
<p>This is just one of many random simulation runs.  The difficulty changes
are somewhat suprising.  On 7 occasions the difficulty increases by more
than 5% and on 3 it reduces by more than 5% (over a much larger number
of runs the number higher and lower are typically the same; in this
instance if we move the threshold to 4% then it&rsquo;s 8 higher and 7
lower).</p>
<p>Our intuition about the difficulty basically staying the same isn&rsquo;t
actually wrong, it&rsquo;s just that that&rsquo;s an average behaviour.  Run the
simulations for long enough and everything levels out.  Each set of 2016
blocks takes almost exactly 14 days to find.</p>
<p>Doubters may question the simulation because negative difficulty changes
have been so rare, but for most of the last 5 years the hashing rate has
been climbing.  Even when it wasn&rsquo;t climbing at current levels though it
was still generally increasing.  With this first simulation, as long
as the hashing rate increases by more than 5% then we will rarely see a
negative difficulty change.  By Bitcoin standards, 5% is a very gentle
growth rate.  If we have 14 successive difficulty changes of 5% then we
end up at 1.98x the original hashing rate.  That same 14 difficulty
changes would take 186.7 days; more than 6 months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little difficult to extract the increase in hashing rate from
the current difficulty levels, but let&rsquo;s assume it has had still a
steady exponential growth.  The steady rate would be 16.9% for the last 4
months.  The assumption doesn&rsquo;t strictly hold as we&rsquo;re seeing a gradual
slowdown but even with the simplification we can still see that the
variance from our 16.9% is very similar to what the simulation shows:</p>

<p>The variations here are slightly larger than we would expect for just
our random noise but the rate at which hashing is added to the network
can&rsquo;t be completely steady.  The behaviour is very close to what the
statistical model predicts.</p>
<p>One simulation isn&rsquo;t anywhere near sufficient of course.  As we compare
more trials though the behaviour is essentially the same.  Here are 2
different simulation runs overlaid on top of our original one:</p>
<p><img src="./simulation_x3.png" alt="simulation x3"></p>
<p>The good news for miners is that for every spike that goes up there&rsquo;s
one that goes down, but the cries of despair from the latest 18.10%
difficulty change are already echoing around the Internet.  Unlike space,
where no-one can hear your scream, it seems that in Cyberspace a little
noise can sometimes be very loud indeed!</p>
