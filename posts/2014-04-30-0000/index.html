                    <p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve written about patterns and trends in
Bitcoin mining while I&rsquo;ve been trying to predict how things will
evolve.  More recently I&rsquo;ve built simulations that attempt to model how
various trends will affect the mining network.  Irrespective of the
&ldquo;improvements&rdquo;, be they improved hashing rates, lower power
consumption per hash, lower price per kWh of electricity or higher BTC
price, one thing is inescapable: The Bitcoin difficulty increases
quickly absorb everything thrown at them in order to maintain the
system&rsquo;s block finding rate.  This has very significant implications for
the not-too-distant future.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-difficulty">The role of difficulty</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin difficulty concept is a very elegant approach to ensure that
no matter how the hashing infrastructure changes the intrinsic
timescales envisaged for Bitcoin mining stay essentially the same.  The
design allows for the system to remain computationally stable and secure
as technology changes and expansions in the numbers of participants take
place.  It also helped solve a problem of how to start up (bootstrap) the
mining network. Mining could use commodity hardware that already existed
and had other purposes.  It also required no capital investment, just the
additional cost of running PCs at higher CPU loads than they had been.</p>
<p>As Bitcoins started to become worth money, however, the prospect of
mining a larger share of them has been ever more enticing.  Mining became
an end in itself, rather than just a means to support the transmission
of Bitcoins. Once mining became seen as valuable there was a clear
challenge to any intent that miners would co-operate for the good of the
network.  Instead individuals could gain an advantage, albeit at the
expense of everyone else.  The behaviour of miners essentially became a
real-world prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.</p>
<h2 id="prisoners-dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</h2>
<p>In the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, two prisoners, A and B, suspected of
committing the same crime (and for which there is no other evidence) are
arrested and held such that they cannot communicate with each other.
Each has a choice: confess (known as defecting) or remain silent (known
as cooperating).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="Prisoners_Dilemma.png"
         alt="Depiction of the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilema.  Image by Chris Jensen and Greg Riestenberg"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Depiction of the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilema.  Image by Chris Jensen and Greg Riestenberg</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The choices lead to 4 possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A and B both stay silent: both go free</li>
<li>A and B both confess: both get 2 years in jail</li>
<li>A confesses and B stays silent: A gets 1 year in jail and B gets 3
years in jail.</li>
<li>A stays silent and B confesses: A gets 3 years in jail and B gets 1
year in jail.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly the best option is for both to stay silent (neither acts to harm
the interests of the other), but the average outcome is: (0.25 * 0) +
(0.25 * 1) + (0.25 * 3) + (0.25 * 2) = 1.5 years in jail.  The
potential risk of getting 3 years in jail is probably enough to have
more confess than not but there&rsquo;s no strong favourite position.  If A
confesses then it&rsquo;s a 50:50 chance of a positive or negative result</p>
<p>Now imagine the same game but with 3 members of the same criminal gang -
if any one confesses either of the others who stays silent get the full
3 year penalty, while all those who do confess get just 1 year in jail.
There are 8 possible options here and the average result is still 1.5
years in jail.  Now, however, if A stays silent then only 1 out of the 4
outcomes is positive (0 years) and 3 out of the 4 are the most negative
(3 years).  Remaining silent now carries an average cost of 9/4 = 2.25
years in jail.  Conversely confessing now carries an average cost of 5/4
= 1.25 years in jail!</p>
<p>This is the core of the problem with Bitcoin difficulty, but the
outcomes are slightly different.  With mining we have a zero sum game
(the total result however played is the same).  Consider 2 miners:</p>
<ol>
<li>A and B have the same hardware: both get 50% of the mining reward</li>
<li>A and B both double their hashing rates: both get 50% of the mining
reward</li>
<li>A doubles their hashing rate but B does not: A gets 67% of the
mining reward, B gets 33%.</li>
<li>A keeps the same hardware but B doubles their hashing rate: A gets
33% of the mining reward, B gets 67%</li>
</ol>
<p>In this version the average is still 50% of the total, but now defecting
(increasing hashing rate) averages 58.3% of the mining reward vs 41.7%
for cooperating.  If we play the same game with 3 miners then all start
with 33.3% of the total, but cooperating averages only 26% and defecting
averages 41%.  Statistically it seems obvious that defecting and doubling
hash rates leads to the best outcome.  Of course all of the miners know
this so where possible they will always defect; it becomes an ongoing
race to try to continually leapfrog the other players.  Sometimes a
player will choose to leave the game but then another will likely try to
join and ultimately no-one gains an advantage.</p>
<p>Interestingly one of Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s last public posts (2010-12-12)
alluded to this same problem: &ldquo;We should have a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement
to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the
network&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s unclear just how far he had gone in thinking about this though.</p>
<p>This then is the headache for mining.  The headlong race of miners trying
to prevent anyone else from outdoing themselves simply leads to a point
where all of the resources that each miner can bring to bear end up
fully consumed in the arms race itself.  A very small number of miners
will make money (where they have a short-term advantage) and exit the
game, while most will make long-term losses.</p>
<h2 id="the-runaway-mining-headache">The runaway mining headache</h2>
<p>As with gold rushes of the past, most of the money has recently flowed to
suppliers who have enabled ever-larger-scale mining.  While much more
efficient than previous generations the difficulty levels increased
exponentially to absorb the improvements and the trend towards
ever-increasing operating costs was simply deferred, not prevented.  A
short term respite has recently seen a move to locations with lower cost
electricity suppliers but this has simply freed up money to spend on yet
more hashing capacity and that in turn requires more electricity.  There
are probably a few more short term improvements that might be made, such
as utilizing waste heat in some more useful way, but these too only act
to make more money available to increase hashing capacity.  Even BTC
price increases only offer temporary respite.  Whatever the cause, the
difficulty level increases accordingly and this quickly negates any
benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already apparent that difficulty level increases are also
affecting the price of hardware.  This has started to fall in order to
offer any potential prospect of useful mining rewards.  Technology limits
mean that technology improvements do not offer a path to enable the
necessary cost reductions, so hardware vendors margins are being cut
too.  Inexorably the balance will continue to move towards operating
costs consuming almost all of the available mining rewards.</p>
<p>In traditional &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; problems the participants often end up
mutually agreeing to try to de-escalate things and verify that all
parties have honoured their commitments, but the decentralized nature of
Bitcoin mining means that such agreements are all but impossible; the
participants just aren&rsquo;t knowable.</p>
<p>Other cryptocurrencies have tried to prevent an arms race by making
things harder for custom hardware.  While this relieves some short-term
pressure any computational problem ends up susceptible to the same
economic pressures.  Given the scope of Bitcoin mining deployments it
seems improbable that changing the core hashing algorithm would be an
option anyway.</p>
<p>Early miners and ASIC suppliers have already seen their profits, and
indeed may still earn more yet.  They can sit on a sunny beach sipping
champagne cocktails, but as the difficulty levels eat into everyone
else&rsquo;s margins it&rsquo;s unclear how the mining dilemma can end up having a
happy ending for anyone else but the energy suppliers.</p>
