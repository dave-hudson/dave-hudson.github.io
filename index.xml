      <description>A number of times in the past I&#39;ve found myself wanting to blog about some of the things I&#39;ve been reading about, thinking about, or working on. Somehow, though, I&#39;ve never managed to make the habit stick.
I think part of the problem is that I will always be a software developer at heart and prepackaged, WYSIWYG, tools that have limited flexibility never quite appealled to me (that and disliking the bloaty databases and slow rendering behind most of them).</description>

      <description>When I&#39;ve had a little more time this part of the site will collect interesting things into one place. When it does you may have an irresistible urge to browse the content, but in the meantime I&#39;ll just let you imagine what that might be like!</description>

      <description>Dave (apparently always pictured with a drink!)   Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening and welcome! (delete as appropriate)
I&#39;m a unrepentant geek who loves all things engineering, scientific or otherwise techie. I would say I love maths too, but I should probably leave that to the experts :-)
I&#39;ve been playing with computers and writing software since I was 9 which is way more years than I care to think about.</description>
