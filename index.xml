      <description>When I started this site I always planned that it would help me organise information, not just be a blog. These blog notes are just my stream of conciousness, with a primary purpose being to think about how and why the real content is managed.
One of the major things I wanted to organise is a large collection of research papers that I&amp;rsquo;ve been accumulating ever since I first got an Internet connection (1992).</description>

      <description>When I decided to create this site, one of the main things I wanted to do was keep the blog as something of a journal. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this in the past when I was writing a C++ library, C8 and it was an interesting experience.
While my earlier efforts related to something a little more complex, one of the reasons I found the exercise interesting was that it would allow me, and others, to come back and review what I did and why.</description>

      <title>Making this site work for real (AKA no more Git submodules)</title>
      <link>https://dave-hudson.github.io/posts/2020-01-24-2140/</link>

      <description>So I think I typed too soon yesterday. Git submodules may be tolerable to some people but after another hour wasted on them today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to admit defeat and find another path. It turns out that putting the publication directory at the same level as the source directory for this site is a far simpler way to make things work. All it takes is putting ../ in publishDir and we&amp;rsquo;re ok :-)</description>

      <description>One of the more fun things about setting up this site (or at least fun for me!) is getting to have vim open again, and being able to see how my words will properly be marked up and translated. I guess it makes me remember what it is to be someone who does this day in and out (organising teams of engineers is fun, but I do miss building code sometimes).</description>

      <description>A number of times in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wanting to blog about some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about, thinking about, or working on. Somehow, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to make the habit stick.
I think part of the problem is that I will always be a software developer at heart and prepackaged, WYSIWYG, tools that have limited flexibility never quite appealed to me (that and disliking the bloaty databases and slow rendering behind most of them).</description>

      <description>Dave (apparently always pictured with a drink!)   Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening* and welcome! (*please delete as appropriate)
I&amp;rsquo;m an unrepentant geek who loves all things engineering, scientific or otherwise techie. I would say I love maths too, but I should probably leave that to the experts :-)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with computers and writing software since I was 9 which is way more years than I care to think about.</description>
