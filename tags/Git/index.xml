      <description>So I think I typed too soon yesterday. Git submodules may be tolerable to some people but after another hour wasted on them today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to admit defeat and find another path. It turns out that putting the publication directory at the same level as the source directory for this site is a far simpler way to make things work. All it takes is putting ../ in publishDir and we&amp;rsquo;re ok :-)</description>

      <description>One of the more fun things about setting up this site (or at least fun for me!) is getting to have vim open again, and being able to see how my words will properly be marked up and translated. I guess it makes me remember what it is to be someone who does this day in and out (organising teams of engineers is fun, but I do miss building code sometimes).</description>
