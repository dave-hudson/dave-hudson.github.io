      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s a theme in my life it has been an obsession with computers. I started when I was 9 and still have books on my shelves from the late 70s and early 80s when that passion was new - thank you, Dad! Every one of those books, and their successors, taught me a new way to understand and imagine things I could get computers to do.
