      <title>A market for Bitcoin transaction fees?</title>

      <description>Most participants in the ongoing Bitcoin block size debates have a point of agreement; that a shortage of block space should have an effect on transaction fees. Arguments aside, then, let&amp;rsquo;s see what has actually been happening. Are fees going through the roof? Are miners going to be celebrating a potential offset to the block reward halving that looms in July 2016? The results seem a little surprising!
Rewards for a Bitcoin miner Bitcoin miners earn their per-block rewards in two ways.</description>

      <title>Behold mighty exahash, hammer of the blocks!</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Exahash&amp;rdquo; sounds like it could well have been the hammer of the Norse Gods of old as it defeated all in battle. In the Bitcoin world of early 2016, however, a mining network that achieves one exahash per second will soon become part of the new folklore. It will, as others before it, quantitatively destroy all earlier incarnations of itself.
Common wisdom that this ever-increasing hash rate makes the Bitcoin network continually stronger, but what does that strength mean?</description>

      <description>In November 2014 I wrote an article, &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin traffic bulletin&amp;rdquo; that sought to look at what happens if the Bitcoin network started to get congested. Since then there has been considerable debate about the Bitcoin block size and there are now many proposals to increase block capacity.
The original asked questions about what it would mean to reach, say, 50% block capacity but events have moved on and we&amp;rsquo;re at nearer to 60% at the time of writing.</description>

      <description>Bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes to find don&amp;rsquo;t they? Well, actually no they don&amp;rsquo;t. Sometimes they can be found really quickly, but other times they can take a very long time. Just to make things confusing, the gaps between blocks can change depending on whether the hashing network is stable, expanding or contracting. What if we need 6 blocks (to get 6 confirmations)?
So what should we expect? What happens during hashing growth phases, and what would happen if the network were to lose large amounts of hashing capacity?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s well described how Bitcoin has a one Megabyte block limit; it&amp;rsquo;s defined in the Bitcoin Core source code. The knowledge of that 1 Mbyte limit has even served in some of my analysis such as &amp;ldquo;The future of Bitcoin transaction fees?&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin traffic bulletin&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;7 transactions per second? Really?&amp;quot;. Turns out that I was wrong; in practice this limit is actually quite a lot smaller!
A puzzle Back in &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin traffic bulletin&amp;rdquo; we saw how first transaction confirmation times were highly dependent on how full mined blocks were.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Ittay Eyal published an intriguing paper, &amp;ldquo;The Miner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&amp;quot;. It describes an attack where an open mining pool may be attacked using block withholding. Given that most Bitcoin mining is managed by open mining pools then it seems like it ought to raise a few eyebrows (perhaps more than it has already). Just how does this attack work though, who wins, who loses and by how much?</description>

      <description>Bitcoin is often touted as having substantially lower fees associated with using it than most other financial systems, but fees and costs are very different things. The reality of things in the Bitcoin ecosystem is rarely simple, and this one is no exception. What then are the actual numbers, where are they heading and what are the consequences?
Transaction fees Probably the biggest challenge in looking at the costs of transactions is to work out what that actually means.</description>

      <description>The general wisdom seems to be that the Bitcoin network can currently sustain 7 transactions per second. Bitcoin advocates often worry that this will be a limiting factor when credit card processing networks can handle several orders of magnitude more transactions in the same time, but what are the actual statistics related to Bitcoin transaction processing? Our Bitcoin mine train may not be seeing its hashing engines running away quite as much as they were earlier this year, but are we heading for other problems instead?</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to get a return when we mine Bitcoins? Should we mine on our own, mine with a small pool or mine with a large pool? How much difference does it really make?
Whether we want to be a gambler or an investor is really a question of how much risk we&amp;rsquo;re prepared to take, but what are those risks and what are the odds of success?</description>

      <description>Every so often a Bitcoin mining pool is reported to manage more than half of the Bitcoin hashing capacity, exposing the spectre of a so called &amp;ldquo;51% attack&amp;rdquo;. Ignoring the perceived threat though, can we really trust the statistics? We&amp;rsquo;ve seen, previously, that Bitcoin mining statistics aren&amp;rsquo;t quite as obvious as we might hope, so what do they look like in these cases?
A day in the life of a 50% mining pool Let&amp;rsquo;s look at what happens when a Bitcoin mining pool has 50% of the actual global hash rate and see what the estimated statistics look like for 24 hours.</description>

      <description>2016 blocks is the magic number that corresponds to each change in difficulty within the Bitcoin network. Nominally it should take 14 days to find this many blocks, but how long does it really take?
The simple case In an earlier article, &amp;ldquo;Hash rate headaches&amp;quot;,Â I looked at the probabilities of finding a particular number of blocks in a given time. This time around the goal is to work out how long it takes to find 2016 blocks.</description>

      <description>Bitcoin difficulty and hash rate statistics should be considered an illness. The symptoms include anxiety, depression, sleeplessness and paranoia. Bitcoin miners follow their every movement, rejoicing at smaller-than-expected difficulty changes and collectively dismaying when things go the other way. Authoritative-looking charts have people puzzling about why things are so erratic and chasing non-existent mining conspiracies. The truth is out there...
Difficulty charts When we start to think about mining, difficulty charts are not far away.</description>

      <description>About 3 months ago I looked at how the BTC price seems to spike up approximately every 7 months. It seems to be happening again!
Over the last couple of weeks the BTC price has reversed its earlier falls and has yet again started to jump back up again. The timing is pretty-much consistent with previous spikes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the graph (plotted on a logarithmic Y axis):
The trend of high points in the graph (red line) shows another theme park ride: The Bitcoin runaway roller coaster.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows that mining is a noisy task. Did you realize just how noisy Bitcoin mining is though? These aren&amp;rsquo;t the noises you were looking for&amp;hellip;
 A Simple Question An earlier article, &amp;ldquo;Hash Rate Headaches&amp;quot;, looked at the statistics associated with Bitcoin mining and how it is a random Poisson Process. It was pretty clear that the global hashing rate, and thus the Bitcoin mining difficulty, are subject to quite a lot of noise, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely obvious how much.</description>

      <description>One of the more infuriating challenges when trying to do any sort of analysis of Bitcoin mining is to understand the current world-wide hashing rate and how this affects difficulty changes. The very best &amp;ldquo;live update&amp;rdquo; websites seem to show the hash rate being all over the place. Large spikes occur frequently and it appears that huge amounts of hashing capacity have either come online or gone offline. This explanation may appeal to conspiracy theorists, and will sometimes be the real cause, but there is a much more mundane reason most of the time (but nonetheless surprising).</description>

As the web has a habit of breaking over time, there&amp;rsquo;s a PDF of this too: Bitcoins-Made-in-China.pdf.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve written about patterns and trends in Bitcoin mining while I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to predict how things will evolve. More recently I&amp;rsquo;ve built simulations that attempt to model how various trends will affect the mining network. Irrespective of the &amp;ldquo;improvements&amp;rdquo;, be they improved hashing rates, lower power consumption per hash, lower price per kWh of electricity or higher BTC price, one thing is inescapable: The Bitcoin difficulty increases quickly absorb everything thrown at them in order to maintain the system&amp;rsquo;s block finding rate.</description>

      <description>One of the more common questions asked when people think about the scale of Bitcoin mining is just how much electricity is being spent supporting the worldwide hashing activities. The question becomes more interesting once it&amp;rsquo;s realized that hashing performs no useful function other than to support mining.
While the green footprint is of interest to many, the electricity costs turn out to play a much more interesting role in predicting future mining behaviour.</description>

      <description>Bitcoin mining can be a very profitable activity. It&amp;rsquo;s good that it is because Bitcoin, as a system, only works because of the mining activity; it&amp;rsquo;s the mining that ensures the transactions actually take place. Just how much money does it generate though and does this help us make any predictions for the future?
Like mining any other finite resource, Bitcoin mining gets harder over time and requires more investment to mine profitably.</description>

      <description>ASIC mining is now the norm for Bitcoin, and 28 nm ASICs are now becoming the mainstream replacing the 65 nm, or even 110 nm, designs of a year ago. Bitcoin ASICs have leapfrogged several integrated circuit (IC) technologies in a way that&amp;rsquo;s rarely been seen before and at an almost unprecedented rate of progress.
How have things been able to move so fast, how much further can this go, and what might we expect from new designs?</description>

      <description>Which comes first: The miners or the money? Much as the old question of &amp;ldquo;Which came first: The chicken or the egg?&amp;rdquo; there appears to have been a lot of debate about whether the price of Bitcoins is a result of mining activity or whether mining activity is the result of the price of Bitcoins.
The generally-held belief is that as the value of Bitcoins has increased there has been more interest in Bitcoins and this has in turn driven miners to mine, but is it really this simple?</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something odd about the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoins. The data shows a set of spikes when the price jumps up and then falls back somewhat and levels out. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so unusual if the spikes occurred intermittently but in the case of Bitcoins the spikes happen with a very surprising regularity!
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the graph:
The first thing to note is that the graph is plotted with a logarithmic Y axis so each step indicates a price point ten times larger than the one below.</description>

      <description>Bitcoin mining is seemingly unique. There has probably never been any technology problem that has triggered such sustained growth and it may be a very long time before we see another one. A convergence of the scalable Bitcoin protocol design, readily available technology, money and mining incentives have accelerated this particular mine train in a truly explosive way. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the trends and what they suggest for future mining activities.</description>
