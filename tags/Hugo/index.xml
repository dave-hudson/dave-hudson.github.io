      <description>So I think I typed too soon yesterday. Git submodules may be tolerable to some people but after another hour wasted on them today it&#39;s time to admit defeat and find another path. It turns out that putting the publication directory at the same level as the source directory for this site then it&#39;s easy make things work. All it takes is putting ../ in publishDir and we&#39;re ok :-)</description>

      <description>One of the more fun things about setting up this site (or at least fun for me!) is getting to have vim open again, and being able to see how my words will properly be marked up and translated. I guess it makes me remember what it is to be someone who does this day in and out (organising teams of engineers is fun, but I do miss building code sometimes).</description>

      <description>A number of times in the past I&#39;ve found myself wanting to blog about some of the things I&#39;ve been reading about, thinking about, or working on. Somehow, though, I&#39;ve never managed to make the habit stick.
I think part of the problem is that I will always be a software developer at heart and prepackaged, WYSIWYG, tools that have limited flexibility never quite appealled to me (that and disliking the bloaty databases and slow rendering behind most of them).</description>
