      <description>When I was blogging back in 2014/2015 I used Joomla to create the hashingit.com content. I really did fall out of love with Joomla though. It was slow to render things, and the site footprint was huge. Despite all that, when I decided to start this new site I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose that content, so decided to import all the old content.
While extracting the contents was fairly easy, converting it all to markdown and correcting errors was something I&amp;rsquo;m not in any great hurry to do again.</description>

      <description>A number of times in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wanting to blog about some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about, thinking about, or working on. Somehow, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to make the habit stick.
Back in 2014/2015 I did manage to get into quite a good habit of blogging about Bitcoin mining but then I ended up busy and the blogging fell aside. I&amp;rsquo;d also falled out of love with Joomla as a blogging platform.</description>
