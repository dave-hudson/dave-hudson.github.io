      <description>When I decided to create this site, one of the main things I wanted to do was keep the blog as something of a journal. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this in the past when I was writing a C++ library, C8 and it was an interesting experience.
While my earlier efforts related to something a little more complex, one of the reasons I found the exercise interesting was that it would allow me, and others, to come back and review what I did and why.</description>
