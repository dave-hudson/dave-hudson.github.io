      <description>Note 2020-03-06: An earlier, longer, version of this was published on Medium and LinkedIn. This version has been slightly edited to be a bit less of a sales pitch for my then-team, Solutions Engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to note that in the 14 months since the original article, the team has gone on to bigger and better things, continuing to help customers &amp;ldquo;get real&amp;rdquo; with Corda.
 It’s pretty-much impossible to avoid the pronouncements in both the technical and mainstream press about how blockchain is going to change the world.</description>
