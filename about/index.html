<p>Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening* and welcome! <em>(*please delete as appropriate)</em></p>
<p>I'm a unrepentant geek who loves all things engineering, scientific or otherwise techie.  I would say I love maths
too, but I should probably leave that to the experts :-)</p>
<p>I've been playing with computers and writing software since I was 9 which is way more years than I care to think about.
In that time I've had the pleasure of working on everything from massive scale embedded systems (IoT before anyone called
it that) to mainframes, and now to decentralised systems.  Along the way I stopped to build operating systems,
network stacks, compilers.  For a while I also helped design CPU instruction sets.</p>
<p>That journey has led me all over the world and I've had the privilege of collaborating with some amazing people.  I live
in North Wales (UK), but for 17 years I &ldquo;commuted&rdquo; to Northern California.  Now my travels tend to take me slightly
less far, but instead split my time between parts of North Wales, London (UK) and Dublin (Ireland).</p>
<p>A number of years ago I got interesting in blockchain technology and now have the privilege to lead an amazing team of
very talented engineers at <a href="http://r3.com">R3</a>, where we build <a href="http://corda.net">Corda</a>.  If you want a peek at how
decentralized computing is evolving then it's well worth a look (but then I would say that, wouldn't I?)</p>
<h1 id="whats-this-site-about">What's This Site About?</h1>
<p>This site is a little bit of an experiment.  Over the years I've researched and developed a lot of things I think are
interesting, and I wanted to have somewhere to try and share some of what I've learned and some of what I learn as I go along.
If you do find anything interesting then please feel free to reach out to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/hashingitcom">Twitter</a>
or <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/davejh/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<h1 id="credits">Credits</h1>
<p>The site it put together using <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and borrowed heavily from a formatting theme called
<a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/ezhil/">Ezhil</a>.  While the formatting has evolved quite a lot from that I strongly
believe in giving credit where it's due and would like to recognise the work of all involved - you have all saved me
a lot of time!</p>
